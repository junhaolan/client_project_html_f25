        Your portfolio is a living record of your journey as an information professional. As you evolve at UMSI,
        continue updating your portfolio with new projects, skills, and experiences. Take time to reflect on your
        accomplishments, seek feedback from peers and mentors, and look for opportunities to share your work with
        broader audiences—whether in class, at career fairs, or through online showcases. By consistently nurturing your
        portfolio, you not only document your achievements, but also demonstrate growth, initiative, and a genuine
        passion for your field.
