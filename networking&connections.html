            <h2>Enhance Your Networking Skills</h2>
            <p>
                Building a strong professional network takes intention, practice, and the right strategies. At UMSI, we
                encourage students to develop essential relationship-building skills that can open doors throughout your
                academic and professional journey. Here are some practical ways to enhance your networking abilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare Your Introduction:</strong> Craft a brief and engaging self-introduction that
                    highlights your interests, background, and goals. This “elevator pitch” will help you make a
                    positive first impression when meeting new people at events or online forums.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Start Meaningful Conversations:</strong> Don’t be afraid to ask questions and show genuine
                    curiosity about others’ experiences. Listen actively and look for shared interests to establish
                    common ground. Remember, networking is about building relationships, not just exchanging
                    information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Follow Up Thoughtfully:</strong> After meeting someone, follow up with a friendly message.
                    Express your appreciation for the conversation, mention something you found valuable, and suggest
                    ways to stay in touch. Consistent, polite follow-up can turn a brief interaction into a lasting
                    connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay Involved in the UMSI Community:</strong> Attend networking events, join student
                    organizations, and participate in group projects. These activities provide natural opportunities to
                    meet classmates, faculty, and alumni who share your interests and can support your professional
                    growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leverage Online Platforms:</strong> Use digital tools such as campus forums or group chats
                    to stay connected with peers and learn about new networking opportunities. Professional profiles and
                    active engagement in online discussions can help you expand your reach beyond campus.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Developing your networking skills is a lifelong process. Each conversation and event is a chance to
                learn, connect, and grow. If you’re unsure where to start, reach out to the UMSI Career Development
                Office for personalized advice.
